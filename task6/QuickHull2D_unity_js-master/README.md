# Quick Hull 2D Using Javascript and Unity
Quick Hull (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickhull) 2D implementation with Unity and Javascript

This is a simple 2d implementation of Convex hull using Quick Hull algorithm.
This code is done with Javascript, HTML and drawn with Unity functions.

To use, just download it and run the HTML file to see the output.

The code is well commented and well organised, so I think you would not fall in any problem in using this code.
